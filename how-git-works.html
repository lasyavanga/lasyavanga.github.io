            If we want to store our valuables, we go to the bank, if we want to
            store code, we use Git. There are many places to store code like
            GitHub, BitBucket, and GitLab. Today, I will show you some things
            you can do in GitHub.
        </p>
        <p class="git-p">
            Instead of keeping everything messed up, you can organize it. Thatâ€™s
            why we use repositories. To create a new repository press New. Then
            type the name of your repository. The name should not have any
            spaces, the name should be all lowercase and the name should be
            hyphen separated. You can add a description but it is optional. You
            can choose if it should be public or private. Public means that
            everyone could see it and private means that only you can see it.
            Then you can add a README page. A README is a page that explains
            what your project is about.
        </p>
        <p class="git-p">
            If you want to change it from public to private then you can go to
            Settings &gt; Options, then scroll down to Danger Zone and click
            Change Visibility.
        </p>
        <p class="git-p">
            If you want to give your repository to someone else, then go to
            Danger Zone and press Transfer.
        </p>
        <p class="git-p">
            If you want to change your repository access, then go to Danger Zone
            and press Archive.
        </p>
        <p class="git-p">
            If you want to delete your repository, then go to Danger Zone and
            press Delete Repository.
        </p>
        <p class="git-p">
            After you create the repository, go to Code &gt; Copy (which is the
            green button that looks like a clipboard). Then go to Terminal and
            type &quot;git clone&quot;. After you did that, paste the url in the
            same line. Then in the next line type git config user.email"Type
            email here". Then in the next line type git config user.name"Type
            name here". And then type &quot;git status&quot;. Then type
            &quot;code .&quot;. This will take you to Visual Studio Code (if it
            is installed or you will have to install it). Then create a new file
            and make the changes that you want to make.
        </p>
        <p class="git-p">
            Now, press the button under the magnifying glass on the left. That
            is where you have to commit all your changes. After that, press the
            file you made changes on, and see if they seem right. Then press the
            + next to the file you made changes in. This will add the changes
            you made. Then press the box and explain what you changed or added.
            Then go to the Terminal and type &quot;git push&quot;. Then type
            your user name and your password. This will push the changes you
            made and make them visible to everyone that can see your
            repositories. Then repeat all the steps and then make more changes!
