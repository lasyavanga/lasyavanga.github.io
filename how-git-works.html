    <p>If we want to store our valuables we go to the bank, if we want to store code we use Git. There are many places
        to store
        code like GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab.
        I will show you some things in GitHub. Instead of keeping everything messed up
        you can organize it. Thatâ€™s why we use repositories. To create a new repository press New. Then type the name of
        your
        repository. The name should not have any spaces, the name should be all lowercase and the name should be hyphen
        separated. You can add a description but it is optional. You can choose if it should be public or private.
        Public means
        that everyone could see it and private means that only you can see it. Then you can add a README page. A README
        is a
        page that explains what your project is about. If you want to change it from public to private then you can go
        to
        Settings and go to Options and then scroll down to Danger Zone and press Change Visibility. If you want to give
        your
        repository to someone else then go to Danger Zone and press Transfer. If you want to not modify or add anything
        then go
        to Danger Zone and press Archive. If you want to delete your repository then go to Danger Zone and press Delete
        Repository. After you create the repository go to Code. Then press the green Code button and then press the button that looks like a clipboard, this will copy the url. Then go to Terminal and type git clone. After you did that paste the url in the same line. And in the next line
