            If we want to store our valuables we go to the bank, if we want to
            store code we use Git. There are many places to store code like
            GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab. I will show you some things in GitHub.
            Instead of keeping everything messed up you can organize it. Thatâ€™s
            why we use repositories. To create a new repository press New. Then
            type the name of your repository. The name should not have any
            spaces, the name should be all lowercase and the name should be
            hyphen separated. You can add a description but it is optional. You
            can choose if it should be public or private. Public means that
            everyone could see it and private means that only you can see it.
            Then you can add a README page. A README is a page that explains
            what your project is about. If you want to change it from public to
            private then you can go to Settings and go to Options and then
            scroll down to Danger Zone and press Change Visibility. If you want
            to give your repository to someone else then go to Danger Zone and
            press Transfer. If you want to not modify or add anything then go to
            Danger Zone and press Archive. If you want to delete your repository
            then go to Danger Zone and press Delete Repository. After you create
            the repository go to Code. Then press the green Code button and then
            press the button that looks like a clipboard, this will copy the
            url. Then go to Terminal and type git clone. After you did that
            paste the url in the same line. And in the next line go to your
            folder. Then in the next line type git config user.email"Type your
            email here". Then in the next line type git config user.name"Type
            your name here". In the next line type git status. Then type code .
            . Then create a new file and make some changes . After you did that
            go to Terminal and type git status. Then go to Visual Studio Code
            and press the button under the magnifying glass on the left. Then
            press the file you made changes in and see if it is right. Then
            press the box above your file name on the left and type what you
            changed. Then go to Terminal and type git push. Then type your user
            name and your password. Then you can make any changes you want.
